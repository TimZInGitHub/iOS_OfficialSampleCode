        How you request a charge from your WatchKit app will depend upon how
        your app is architected. Generally speaking, you'll want to use handoff
        and have your iOS app immediately display the payment sheet when it's invoked.
        
        In this example, we'll send the product to be charged in the handoff `userInfo`
        payload. See the `AppDelegate` of the main app for how we process this on iOS.
