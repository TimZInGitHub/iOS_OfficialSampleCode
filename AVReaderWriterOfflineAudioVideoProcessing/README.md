# AVReaderWriter

## Description

AVReaderWriter demonstrates how to use AVAssetReader to read and decode sample data from a movie file, work directly with the sample data, then use AVAssetWriter to encode and write the sample data to a new movie file.

There are two versions: One is written in Objective-C and runs on OS X, the other is written in Swift and runs on iOS.  Despite differing in the area of user interface management, both versions demonstrate the same basic concepts involved in working with raw media data.  The execution of these concepts is concentrated in CyanifyOperation.swift (Swift/iOS version) and AAPLDocument.m (Objective-C/OS X version).

## Build Requirements

Xcode 7.0, OS X 10.11 SDK, iOS 9.0 SDK
