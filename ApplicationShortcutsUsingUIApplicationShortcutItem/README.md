# Application Shortcuts: Using UIApplicationShortcutItem

## Summary

Demonstrates how to use the UIApplicationShortcutItem class in your application so users can quickly access parts of an application through “Quick actions” from the Home screen.  
It implements four different shortcuts, two static defined (UIApplicationShortcutItem) in your Info.pist, two dynamic or mutable (UIMutableApplicationShortcutItem) defined through code.  The mutable shortcuts can be edited to change that title, subtitle and icon.

IMPORTANT: This sample should be run on an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus device. The iPhone simulator will not show the shortcuts.
